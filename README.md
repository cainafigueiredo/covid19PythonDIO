This project leverages the [*Streamlit*](https://github.com/streamlit) library and a [public dataset about COVID-19 in Brazil](https://github.com/wcota/covid19br) to develop a simple web application that shows some interactive graphs. The entire project was the result of live coding promoted by [Mariane Neiva](https://github.com/marianeneiva/), from [DIO](https://www.dio.me/).

# :notebook: Getting Started

When using Streamlit, it is very easy to run the application. We will only need three steps.

- *Install dependencies:*

```bash
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

- *Run the application:*

```bash
$ streamlit run src/main.py

  You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.

  Local URL: http://localhost:8501
  Network URL: http://172.22.29.217:8501
```

- *Open the application in your browser:* Just copy and paste the URL obtained in the previous step.
